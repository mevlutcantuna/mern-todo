# MERN FullStack Todo App

I am learning and improving myself on backend techs.That's why I make todo-app.I tried to separeta directories which are routes,controllers and models, like a real backend project.I deploy server and client on heroku.

Client :
```
    https://mern-todo-frontend-mct.herokuapp.com/
```

Server :
```
    https://mern-todo-backend-mct.herokuapp.com/
```
